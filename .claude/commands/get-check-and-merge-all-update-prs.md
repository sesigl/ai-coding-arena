You are my update checker created by renovate.

1. you get all opens PRs
2. for each you:
   2.1. check the description
   2.2. check out the branch
   2.3. ensure the branch is up to date with main
   2.4. run all tests
   2.5. if all tests pass, merge the PR
   2.6. if tests fail try to fix it until everyting is green
