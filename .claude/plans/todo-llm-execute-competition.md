# LLM Coding Competition System - Implementation Progress

## Status: Planning Complete ✅

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Gathered requirements through iterative questioning
- [x] Created comprehensive specification (spec.md)
- [x] Developed detailed implementation blueprint
- [x] Broke down implementation into 15 carefully sized prompts
- [x] Validated prompt sequence for incremental development
- [x] Ensured TDD approach throughout all prompts
- [x] Created state tracking document (this file)

### Current Status
**Ready for implementation** - All planning and prompt creation complete

### Next Steps
Execute the 15 implementation prompts in sequence:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Prompts 1-3)
- [ ] **Prompt 1**: Project Setup & Event Storage Core
- [ ] **Prompt 2**: Event Store Implementation  
- [ ] **Prompt 3**: Domain Models & Configuration

### Phase 2: LLM Provider Abstraction (Prompts 4-6)
- [ ] **Prompt 4**: LLM Provider Interface
- [ ] **Prompt 5**: File System Operations
- [ ] **Prompt 6**: Claude Code Provider

### Phase 3: Competition Core Logic (Prompts 7-10)
- [ ] **Prompt 7**: Competition Runner Foundation
- [ ] **Prompt 8**: Baseline Creation Phase
- [ ] **Prompt 9**: Bug Injection Phase
- [ ] **Prompt 10**: Fix Attempt Phase

### Phase 4: Results & Statistics (Prompts 11-12)
- [ ] **Prompt 11**: Event Processing Engine
- [ ] **Prompt 12**: Results Generation

### Phase 5: CLI & Integration (Prompts 13-15)
- [ ] **Prompt 13**: CLI Interface
- [ ] **Prompt 14**: End-to-End Integration
- [ ] **Prompt 15**: Additional Provider Support & Finalization

## Implementation Notes

### Key Principles
- **TDD throughout**: Write tests first, implement to make them pass
- **Incremental progress**: Each prompt builds on previous work
- **No orphaned code**: Everything must integrate with existing components
- **Fail-fast approach**: Simple error handling to start
- **Event-sourced design**: All interactions logged for analysis

### Quality Gates
Each prompt should result in:
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ Integration with previous components
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Event logging where applicable

### Dependencies
- Node.js 20+ (LTS)
- TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
- DuckDB (npm package)
- Vitest (testing framework)
- Real CLI tools: `claude` command (Claude Code)

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **CLI Integration Complexity**: Real CLI tools may have unexpected behavior
   - *Mitigation*: Mock providers for testing, integration tests optional
2. **File System Operations**: Cross-platform compatibility issues
   - *Mitigation*: Use Node.js path utilities, comprehensive testing
3. **Event Store Performance**: Large competitions may generate many events
   - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing, query optimization in later prompts
4. **Provider Abstraction**: Different CLIs may have vastly different interfaces
   - *Mitigation*: Start with Claude Code, refine abstraction with Gemini

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete competition can run start to finish
- [ ] Results accurately reflect competition outcomes
- [ ] Event sourcing provides complete audit trail
- [ ] CLI interface is intuitive and helpful
- [ ] System handles errors gracefully with clear messages
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for intended use cases

## Notes for Implementation
- Each prompt is designed to be executed by an LLM code generator
- Prompts include context from previous steps
- Focus on making each step small and testable
- Integration testing ensures components work together
- Documentation and examples included throughout

**Status**: Ready to begin Prompt 1 implementation
