- refactor: use a light dependency injection approach by always creating a class dependency in the constructor when feasible where the default parameter value is the single class that should be used in production. e.g. for classes the use the DebugLogger, you can just create the instance in the constructor. Use such refactorings as opportunities to for example set values like actor which might be the same for all usages given encapsulation is done right.
